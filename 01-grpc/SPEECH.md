Hi, my name is Alex Pliutau, and this is "package name".

<INTRO MUSIC>

It's a very first video in this channel, so I am very excited. Before we're going to the topic of this video, I want to make a short introduction about myself. I write mostly Go these days. And I like to share what Iâ€™m doing. So this channel will be about it.

I am working as tech lead at Wizeline Vietnam based in Ho Chi Minh City.

So one day I asked people on dev.to what do they want to watch about programming in Go, and I found that people are interested in code reviews, new packages and building tools.
